Webassembly interactive figure using plplot

I am going to try and make an interactive web browser figure routine that uses plplot in webassembly to draw the figure and redraw on region selection and panning on the figure. I want to see if this can be more efficient than plotly which seems to bog down with modest numbers of data points.
